Caveat: This project was done to remember how to use Pandas library and utilize different libraries for random generation.

The code ends up generating random digital marketing dataset (most of it is based on different distribution models with some weights here and there to skew the data a bit). 
Documentation is inside the code and to use it you can copy and run it, either by changing the test values for a fixed one, or could use global values and uncomment that text to make it more "user input friendly".

Anyone can use this and incorporate (if they want to)
